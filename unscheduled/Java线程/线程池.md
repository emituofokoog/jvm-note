                              int maximumPoolSize,
                              long keepAliveTime,
                              TimeUnit unit,
                              BlockingQueue<Runnable> workQueue,

                              RejectedExecutionHandler handler) {
        if (corePoolSize < 0 ||
            maximumPoolSize <= 0 ||
            maximumPoolSize < corePoolSize ||
            keepAliveTime < 0)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        if (workQueue == null || threadFactory == null || handler == null)
            throw new NullPointerException();
        this.acc = System.getSecurityManager() == null ?
                null :
                AccessController.getContext();
        this.corePoolSize = corePoolSize;
        this.maximumPoolSize = maximumPoolSize;
        this.workQueue = workQueue;
        this.keepAliveTime = unit.toNanos(keepAliveTime);
        this.threadFactory = threadFactory;
        this.handler = handler;
    }
```

- **corePoolSize** the number of threads to keep in the pool, even if they are idle, unless {@code allowCoreThreadTimeOut} is set
- **maximumPoolSize**  the maximum number of threads to allow in the pool
- **keepAliveTime** 
- **timeUnit**
- **Queue** 线程池队列
- **threadFactory**  the factory to use when the executor creates a new thread
- **handle**  the handler to use when execution is blocked because the thread bounds and queue capacities are reached






```java
private ForkJoinPool(int parallelism,
                         ForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory factory,
                         UncaughtExceptionHandler handler,
                         int mode,
                         String workerNamePrefix) {
        this.workerNamePrefix = workerNamePrefix;
        this.factory = factory;
        this.ueh = handler;
        this.config = (parallelism & SMASK) | mode;
        long np = (long)(-parallelism); // offset ctl counts
        this.ctl = ((np << AC_SHIFT) & AC_MASK) | ((np << TC_SHIFT) & TC_MASK);
    }
```
- **parallelism** the parallelism level(并行度). For default value,use {@link java.lang.Runtime#availableProcessors}
-  **factory**   the factory for creating new threads. For default value,use {@link #defaultForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory}.
-  **handler**      the handler for internal worker threads that terminate due to unrecoverable errors encountered while executing tasks. For default value, use {@code null}.
-  **mode**         if true,establishes local first-in-first-out scheduling mode for forked tasks that are never joined. This mode may be more appropriate than default locally stack-based mode in applications in which worker threads only process event-style asynchronous tasks.For default value, use {@code false}.
-  **workerNamePrefix**
